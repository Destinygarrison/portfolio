# Behavioral Therapist

### cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), crisis intervention, treatment planning, and patient advocacy, I am able to develop individualized care strategies to improve client outcomes and foster long-term resilience. I am adept at using jdoodle, outlook, and exel.

My varying skill set, commitment to mental health awareness, and passion for psychology makes me as a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to write poetry and model.
