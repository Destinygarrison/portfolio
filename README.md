# Projects

## Project 1: Student Organizational Filing System (Outlook)

![Outlook Screenshot](outlook-project.jpg)

This project was based on a prompt to design a better filing system for academic materials.  
I created an organized structure using Outlook and OneDrive to improve file management across multiple psychology courses.

I utilized color-coded folders and naming conventions to save time when searching for files.  
One obstacle I faced was ensuring that different class projects didn’t overlap. I solved this by creating standardized naming patterns.  
If extended, I would automate part of the process using Microsoft Flow.

**Summary:**  
*Designed an academic digital filing system to boost efficiency and reduce lost files.*

## Project 2: Purchasing Decision Spreadsheet (Excel)

This project compared several tech products to help guide purchasing decisions based on specs, price, and features.  
I organized the information using Microsoft Excel tables and functions, applying visual formatting to simplify comparisons.

Challenges included deciding which specs mattered most (CPU speed, RAM, screen size).  
If expanded, I would include weighted scoring formulas for smarter decision-making.

**Summary:**  
*Built an Excel spreadsheet to compare IT products and support smart purchasing decisions.*

## Project 3: Python Grade Calculator (JDoodle)

This Python program was designed to calculate a student's weighted average and final letter grade based on user input for quizzes and assessments.

I used JDoodle's online IDE to write, test, and debug the code.  
One challenge was ensuring the weights of quizzes and assessments always totaled 100%, and I added user input validation to solve it.

**Summary:**  
*Developed a Python program that calculates weighted averages and letter grades using JDoodle.*
