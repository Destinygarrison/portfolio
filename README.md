# Destiny Garrison

## Behavioral Therapist

cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), crisis intervention, treatment planning, and patient advocacy. I am able to develop individualized care strategies to improve client outcomes and foster long-term resilience. I am adept at using JDoodle, Outlook, and Excel.

My varying skill set, commitment to mental health awareness, and passion for psychology make me a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to write poetry and model.
